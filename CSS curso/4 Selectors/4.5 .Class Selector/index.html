    <p><span class="nome">Azuma Higashi (東 アズマ, Higashi Azuma)</span> has great fighting skills as well as a strong sense of justice, and also always gets good grades in his class. His friend <span class="nome">Tokio Kurohara (黒原 トキオ, Kurohara Tokio)</span> is the complete opposite of Azuma: he does not listen in class, and is a bystander when Azuma fights. Different as they might be, their bond is very strong nevertheless. They live in Yamato Prefecture, where the district has almost been destroyed by Choujin, humans with supernatural abilities. When the two are returning home, they encounter a Choujin who threatens to kill them. With no other way of escaping, the two decided to become Choujin themselves. The story centers around their adventures and struggles as they try to navigate the chaotic and often dangerous life of a Choujin.</p>
