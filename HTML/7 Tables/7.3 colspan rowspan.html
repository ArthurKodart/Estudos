<!-- sometimes to fit, or to create more complex layouts you can change
 how much space a cell takes up with colspan and rowspan -->
 <!-- first example we need to have more than one
  mass atribute on a table -->
  <table>
    <thead>
        <!-- to divide the table into sections put all elements you dont want 
         to divide with rowspan and what you want with colspan -->
    <tr>
        <th rowspan="2">1</th>
        <th rowspan="2">1</th>
        <th colspan="2">1</th>
        <th rowspan="2">1</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>2</th>
        <th>2</th>
    </tr>
